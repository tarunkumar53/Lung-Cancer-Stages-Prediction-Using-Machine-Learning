Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

Lung cancer prediction using machine learning involves building algorithms that can analyze medical data (such as CT scans, biomarkers, and patient history) to detect and predict the likelihood of lung cancer. Machine learning models are trained on historical data to recognize patterns associated with the disease, enabling early detection and improving diagnosis accuracy.

Steps in Lung Cancer Prediction:
Data Collection:

Gather patient data, including medical images, clinical history, genetic information, and demographic details.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean, normalize, and preprocess data to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure uniformity. Techniques like image segmentation may be used to process CT scans.
Feature Extraction:

Identify important features or biomarkers that influence lung cancer detection, such as tumor size, shape, and texture in medical images.
Model Selection:

Common machine learning models for lung cancer prediction include:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based analysis.
Training and Validation:

Train the model using labeled data (e.g., known cases of lung cancer), then validate its accuracy using test datasets to ensure reliable predictions.
Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Deployment:

Once validated, the model can be integrated into clinical settings to assist doctors in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
